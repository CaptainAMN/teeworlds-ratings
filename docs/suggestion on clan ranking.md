How the clan ranking should work:

The combined Elo of either line up is to be look upon and processed as a single player to determine the ranking within
the clan section. 

This would mean for a 4on4 with TeamA VS. TeamB: EloA+EloB+EloC+EloD VS. EloE+EloF+EloG+EloH --> EloTeamA VS. EloTeamB

If anyhow possible, the following maps will be a coefficient to either boost the final ELO result or nerf it:

ctf2 has the coefficient "1"

ctf3 has "0.5"

ctf_tantum has "1"

There are no rules on how often a certain team is allowed to play against another team or any other limitation on maps.
