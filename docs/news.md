We are very proud to release the first version of our ranking system to the public.
As a game, teeworlds has grown on many people as a fun to play and endearing leisure time activity.
Some of us have been playing for years and even though the development on the official version
is remaining somewhat stagnant, a lot of contributions to the community have been made by many people. We would
therefore like to thank every contributor to the teeworlds community that keep the scene
of this special game alive with their much appreciated work.

There have been many attempts to enrich the CTF scene at various points in the past. Some very successfull ones
like the TeeComp client by Sushi, some less so like the ClanZone managed by Alucard, that never gained traction 
despite much effort. Somehow the need for an organized place for teams and players has never been satisfied.
Clanwar results and reputation was always considered something that lingered around as word of mouth, since
many screenshots of lost and won clanwars remained scattered around various homepages. Different line ups, declined
clanwars to save face, no re-matches and countless other things were obstacles that kept many players from enjoying
the game and added to the frustration caused by lack of development, atrocious waiting times and playing the same old
two maps for close to a decade now.

These problems still remain within an elitist and shrinking group of players that we call the CTF scene.
Highly skilled, but without direction and purpose, this scene is overshadowed by the DDNET community giant, which now
is by far the biggest player base. The original game types are struggling daily to keep their small player base, with
no chance of getting new players because there is nothing to offer them. A lack of matchmaking support and huge skill gap
is in stark contrast to a well organized DDrace environment, with different skill levels for every player.

Many people have called the death on teeworlds countless times, and it seems like they could have been right all along.
For a game that is simplistic and wonderfully balanced as teeworlds is, it is tough to give it up without a fight.
Therefore we have tried to make one last effort in hopes to get the ball rolling in the right direction, with global matchmaking
for the official client as the ultimate goal.

We therefore present you Teeworlds Rankings, a place for players and clans to receive ranking points and track clanwars, capgames
and many other useful statistics, that have never been available to players before.
It is our attempt to create a competitive environment and have players come back daily to strengthen their efforts in order to be the best
and join the ranks of many notorious Tees in Teeworlds. 

From now on, by using your account, you are given the opportunity to track your personal wins and losses and those of your clan. 
By gathering countless statistics, you will also receive a global rank and be able to climb the ladder of stardom and compare
yourself to the best players world wide. With winning every game, you will move closer to the top spots in the ladder and can check
up on other players and clans and track their history.
Your personal player profile will be full of statistics and useful information to understand and help you reach the best of your skill
and team play.

As an idea that has been in our minds for a long time, we are very happy to be able to invite you to test these new features with us
and explore the world of true competition. 


Your TeeRank team,

AMN, Shiki, Sonix.
