Ideas for the matchmaking system
================================

1) Successful vote to start a league match requires 100% majority. This is to make sure the game can start without delay,
  and other trouble like being afk while everyone warms up.

2) Leaving the game and not rejoining within 5 minutes earns you the same ranking as if you've lost the game and performed very poorly.

3) A new player that comes and replaces someone gets the same points ingame as the worst player on the team.
  For example: If Player B replaces Player A, the topscorer of team blue, B will pick the game up with the same ingame points as Player C,
  who is bottom scorer. He will not pick up where the leaver and topscorer A left. Rinse and repeat if this occasion happens multiple times.

4) For capgames/clanwars (not for TDM): If a league game is in progress, and someone leaves, the game is fully frozen or "paused".
   If a substitute is not found within 5 minutes countdown, the game will end without ranking and the failed game will be under review.
   The leaving player in question will be under Investigation.

   To limit abuse, since players leaving on purpose can damage running games, special moderating activity is necessary, in conjunction with
   requiring the players to save their personal game demo as evidence.
   Also we should reserve the right to ban and exclude anyone if we feel like there is a good reason and enough evidence that rules of good
   sportsmanship have been violated, even if there is no demo available to review.

5) Clans.
   Anyone can register a clan. However, this registration will require a validation, that is an agreement of 3 other players to join that clan. When a clan is validated, a clan leader can add/remove players from his clan by himself.

   If a clan goes down to less than 4 players, validation is again required. (Motivation: only with 4 players you can play ctf2 clanwars, boring games do not count)

   If a clan stays unvalidated for more than 30 days, it's removed from the active clans list and moved to history.

   Every player has a clan history which expands upon player joining or leaving a clan.
