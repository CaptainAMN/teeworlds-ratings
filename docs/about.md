Teeworlds Ratings is the first player and clan management system of its kind with many useful 
features for the vanilla community. It introduces competitive matchmaking for both clanwars and
capgames and a brand new points based vanilla league into the scene. It is aimed at solving the 
age old question: Who is the best and which clan is the strongest?


It offers a global ranking system for players, a points ladder for clans and offers interesting
statistics that would not be accessible otherwise.

Once the player joins a competitive game, data will be collected and passed through a special algorithm
to rate the player based on his skill and win/los ratio. With every game, the player profile
will be updated on this website and give the player his rank in the best-of list.

Ever wondered how good you or your clan is compared to others? Now you will will know, and thanks to the 
statistics, it will be easier than ever to know the areas which could be improved to make you a better player. 

To unite the scattered community, customizable player profiles and clan sections show the latest games played 
and every possible statistic you could think of. Clan rosters and information about individual players will 
keep track of every single event that takes place during competitive games.

Because teeworlds in its current state is a special game, we have tried to adapt to it as much as possible to
account for irregularities. Since clans have sometimes different power levels depending on the line up, the 
ranking system is designed to take that into consideration and award the proper points in every case.

Information on how to use our system is available at How to.
