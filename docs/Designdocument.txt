Design document is as follows:




**************Our goal:





To create a ranking system with a ladder, where we can see which clan is the strongest. Random teams do not have the benefit of a place in the ladder. 

It is reserved for long term teams, a.k.a clans. A clan's ranking actually is based on individual player ratings. The total power of a clan comes from 
it's players. The players individually receive their ranking either by clanwars, or by participating in "official" capgames.







*************The method:




Desired data is collected centrally in a database. To create a new user, you have to register on the webpage that displays our results. You create username 
and password eventually, to connect to the data base when u play, you have to log in from the client.

The result of a little discussion is that we follow  A SIMILAR path as Teerace login system with _probably_ API token edited in the settings.cfg of the player. 
This means that every player has to authentificate before he is able to receive his rating in the database! "login successful" is displayed to the player by 
the server, to confirm the login.

Every line up creates a different total rating for the clan, because we base the clan rating on the combined player rating. Depending on which players you face in
a clan war, you get different points in case u win or draw the game. In reality, the difference in points between different clan line ups will usually not be very big, 
because only exceptionally good or bad players can affect the total clan rating by a big number. But this is still very possible, because these players absolutely exist 
and affect games positively or negatively.






*******The rating system:




It is based off of ingame score. 


For every win: 



in a team, you get base points. Only winning is rewarded. If you perform well or bad in relation to average team score, your base score will receive either extra points or 
get a substraction, and your personal rating will be either boosted or will suffer. Your ranking gains are dependant on the ELO of the other team.


For every loss: 



You do NOT receive points, losing is tough. It's all about the teamplay. The player(s) that caused the loss should get their rating taken down severely.

TO SUMMARIZE:

Everyone gets the same points basically per win, but get better ratings if their scores are exceptionally high or get a really severe punishment if their score is really low.

THE FORMULA: Proposed is that the closer the top scorer is to a factor of "2" (or grerater) of the team's average points ingame, the more extra points you will collect 
for your individual rating.

The closer u are to half (0.5) of the average team score, the more severe the punishment for your rating. If you are even below half of the teams average, your rating should suffer
quite a bit from it (especially if you lose the game!)




********Game modes are: 

ctf3 (3on3) 
ctf2 (4on4,5on5,6on6) 
ctf5 (5on5, 6on6, 7on7,8on8) 
ctf_tantum (4on4)



+++++Special rules for clanwars:+++++

Since all of this is based on ELO, we have to discourage repetitive maps and small teams. We have two options here. Seperate ELO rankings per map, what would be more accurate, but 
lack diversity. Secondly, to add a coefficient for undesired maps, so that your ranking does not get the "full" ranking boost. Else, a team of 3 players could single handedly push 
the ranking into high points simply by only playing ctf3. Ergo, the points you potentially earn will be multiplied by a coefficient that is proprietary to the defined map.

Alas, 

ctf2 has the coefficient "1". 
ctf3 has "0.5" ctf5 has "1.1" 
ctf_tantum has "1".
